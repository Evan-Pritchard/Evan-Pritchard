### Hi there 👋
<!--
**Evan-Pritchard/Evan-Pritchard** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- 🔭 I’m currently working on completing my AS in Computer Science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to develop basic programs with C++ for educational purposes. I've also started experimenting with **SQL** and **Ruby on Rails**.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will teach me new concepts to further my software developer skills.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with working with objects and classes. As I gain experience, I also have a domain to populate: [***p4rigging.com***](http://p4rigging.com)
- 💬 Ask me about being a father to 3 smelly boys.
- 📫 How to reach me: email: evan.pritchard@student.northampton.edu
- 😄 Pronouns: He / Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was the beginner league skydiving canopy piloting champion for the US in 2017.
