**Evan-Pritchard/Evan-Pritchard** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on completing my AS in Computer Science.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to develop basic programs with C++ for educational purposes. I've also started experimenting with **SQL** and **Ruby on Rails**.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that will teach me new concepts to further my software developer skills.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with working with objects and classes. As I gain experience, I also have a domain to populate: [***p4rigging.com***](http://p4rigging.com)
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about being a father to 3 smelly boys.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: email: evan.pritchard@student.northampton.edu
